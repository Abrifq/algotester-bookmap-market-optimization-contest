# Algotester: Bookmap Market Optimization Contest

The code I wrote for Algotester's Bookmap Market Optimization Contest.
The contest has ended by now but I haven't made any more progress than the basic boilerplate code.

I want to return to this on a later date and write some more code for it, though.

The problem.pdf file is NOT my own file but kept here just in case it gets deleted from Algotester's servers.

## What's next?

Well, a solution, a problem creator, a solution grader... and a make file tying all these up, lol.
